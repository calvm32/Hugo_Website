Hi! I'm Calum (Cal) Heldt. 

This website is a personal repository for my various projects and hobbies.

I attend the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and Lincoln (UNL). I plan to attend graduate school for applied math. Eventually, I'll utilize my knowledge to solve environmental problems while teaching. 

If you have any questions, please reach out!
