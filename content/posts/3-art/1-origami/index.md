    title: "Icosahedral Geodesic Polyhedron"
    description: "Made with 480 tornillo units. If you look at the inside set of vertices, it's the {3,5+}_(2,2) geodesic polyhedron. If you look at the outside set of vertices, it's the {5,3+}_(2,2) Goldberg polyhedron. If you consider every face to be that of a geodesic polyhedron, it would be {3,5+}_(6,0)."

Modular origami initiated an interest into the symmetries and construction of polytopes. The repetitive nature of folding hundreds of pieces could also be quite soothing. Most of the origami pictured was made in 2021-2023.
