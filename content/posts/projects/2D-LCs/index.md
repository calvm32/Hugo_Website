The repository ["<i>Q-tensor 2D</i>"](https://github.com/calvm32/q-tensor-2d) is an implementation of the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) Q-tensor model for liquid crystals (LCs) based on Andrew Hicks' ["<i>Q-tensor 3D</i>"](https://github.com/andrewlhicks/q-tensor-3d). Our goal was to learn the LdG method for solving the energy of a system of LCs at equilibrium. 

Yuzhi Liu, Steven Spasov, and I built this repository in May - July 2025 under the direction of [Dr. Andrew Hicks](https://andrewhicks.info/). We were funded by Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the [Summer of Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/math/undergrad/suami/index.html).
