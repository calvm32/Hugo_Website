There is plenty of research investigating properties of liquid crystal (LC) spheres, but little work published about LC shells, the result of removing the volume of a smaller sphere from a larger one. Yuzhi Liu, Dr. Andrew Hicks, and I are working to determine how and why different kinds of defects form in these shells.

Yuzhi Liu, Steven Spasov, and I began this work in May - July 2025 under the direction of [Dr. Andrew Hicks](https://andrewhicks.info/). We were funded by Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the [Summer of Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/math/undergrad/suami/index.html).
