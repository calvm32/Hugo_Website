Since September, 2024, I have worked under the supervision of [Dr. Keith Gallagher](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/mathematics/about-us/directory/keith-gallagher.php) to examine the treatment of logarithms in College Algebra-level resources. 

This work has resulted in one peer-reviewed [conference proceeding](http://sigmaa.maa.org/rume/RUME27_Proceedings.pdf) from SIGMAA on RUME 2025. I gave a talk on this paper at the Nebraska-SE South Dakota [section meeting](https://www.creighton.edu/arts-sciences/math/nebraska-se-south-dakota-section-meeting-maa) of the MAA. 

Currently, I am working on a literature review to further investigate this problem.
