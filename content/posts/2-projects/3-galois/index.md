My current research is using Artin-Schreier presentations to classify Galois
extensions of degree $p^6$ and $p^5$ with maximal nilpotency class over
a field of characteristic $p$, for some prime $p$. From May
2023-24, I was funded by the NASA Nebraska Space Grant. My profile is
featured on the NASA Nebraska Space Grant website [here](https://www.nespacegrant.org/students-2023-2024).


On May 31st, 2024, I presented at the annual Hopf Algebras and Galois Module
Theory Conference in Omaha, Nebraska. The official website can be found
[here](http://www.hopf-galois.org/2024Omaha/index.html). Below are the slides and a video of me presenting them to the audience at
the Omaha 2024 conference.
