I&amp;rsquo;m Calum (Cal) Heldt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This website is a personal repository for my various projects and hobbies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I attend the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and Lincoln (UNL). I plan to attend graduate school for applied math. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll utilize my knowledge to solve environmental problems while teaching.&lt;/p>

Our goal was to learn the LdG method for solving the energy of a system of LCs at equilibrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yuzhi Liu, Steven Spasov, and I built this repository in May - July 2025 under the direction of &lt;a href="https://andrewhicks.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Andrew Hicks&lt;/a>. We were funded by Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the &lt;a href="https://www.cmu.edu/math/undergrad/suami/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer of Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3D Liquid Crystals</title><link>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/projects/3d-lcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/projects/3d-lcs/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is plenty of research investigating properties of liquid crystal (LC) spheres, but little work published about LC shells, the result of removing the volume of a smaller sphere from a larger one. Yuzhi Liu, Dr. Andrew Hicks, and I are working to determine how and why different kinds of defects form in these shells.&lt;/p>

extensions of degree $p^6$ and $p^5$ with maximal nilpotency class over
a field of characteristic $p$, for some prime $p$. From May
2023-24, I was funded by the NASA Nebraska Space Grant. My profile is
featured on the NASA Nebraska Space Grant website &lt;a href="https://www.nespacegrant.org/students-2023-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On May 31st, 2024, I presented at the annual Hopf Algebras and Galois Module
Theory Conference in Omaha, Nebraska. The official website can be found
&lt;a href="http://www.hopf-galois.org/2024Omaha/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>. Below are the slides and a video of me presenting them to the audience at
the Omaha 2024 conference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Math Education Research</title><link>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/projects/math-ed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/projects/math-ed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since September, 2024, I have worked under the supervision of &lt;a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/mathematics/about-us/directory/keith-gallagher.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Keith Gallagher&lt;/a> to examine the treatment of logarithms in College Algebra-level resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This work has resulted in one peer-reviewed &lt;a href="http://sigmaa.maa.org/rume/RUME27_Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conference proceeding&lt;/a> from SIGMAA on RUME 2025. I gave a talk on this paper at the Nebraska-SE South Dakota &lt;a href="https://www.creighton.edu/arts-sciences/math/nebraska-se-south-dakota-section-meeting-maa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section meeting&lt;/a> of the MAA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, I am working on a literature review to further investigate this problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Origami Art</title><link>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/art/origami/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://calheldt.xyz/posts/art/origami/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modular origami initiated an interest into the symmetries and construction of polytopes.
